Third Person Shooter in Unity 6.2

## Features

- ThirdPersonController: We used Unity's StarterAssets for basic controls and locomotives
- Aiming: PlayerAimCamera, AimSensitivity, crosshair only active when the player aims, rotate the player's face when moving the aim, prevent the character from rotating while aiming
- Projectile: switch between Raycast Mode and Projectile Mode for the firing mode
- Animation: Separated the upper body from the lower body, so the lower body is moving individually while the character is aiming.
